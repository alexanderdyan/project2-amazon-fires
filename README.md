# Project 2 Report
## Brazil Fires and Deforestation

#### Authors

#### Project Description

We analyzed fires and deforestation in Brazil, using a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB. Our project track is a custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart), and we chose Chartist to fulfill the requirements of using a JS Libary not covered in class and including user-driven interaction (click to change data displayed).
